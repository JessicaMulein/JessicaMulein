### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**About Me**

- Software Engineer with 25+ years of experience at Microsoft, DHI/Dice, Webfilings/Workiva, and other companies including an internet service provider she started/founded at age 13 which is still in business.
- Musician and composer with music available on most streaming services
- President/COO and founder of [Digital Defiance](https://digitaldefiance.org), a non-profit Open Source Engineering Guild
- Open Source advocate and contributor
- Advocate for women's, minority, and disabled rights

No one knows how much time we have, but if you want to call it a gift- I've been given the foresight of knowing I don't have decades to live. Sooner or later I am going to need to put aside my coding and work on the things that matter in my life and to my wife. There are a great many things in my digital empire I need to convey to her and there are a great many things I need to clean up and filter out and give away.

There is a time for hope, and when that is gone, there is a time for closure and making final arrangements. It is time I accepted that. The hope is slipping away. There could be a medical breakthrough in the next few years, but with the hits to federal research funding and shackles on how doctors and researchers are forced to work right now, I'm not optimistic they will find a solution in time.

Digital Defiance needs a new leader, and my projects need a new torchbearer. If you have any interest in maintaining or progressing any of my projects, BrightChain, etc, please let me know.

ðŸ”­ **Current Projects**

I started an Open Source/FOSS Guild called "[Digital Defiance](https://digitaldefiance.org)" ([GitHub](https://github.com/Digital-Defiance)), a non-profit incorporated in Washington State and officially 501(c)(3). It has absorbed most of my projects. We're actively working on several exciting endeavors:

- **Connect with Us:**
  - Keybase: [keybase.io/team/digitaldefiance](https://keybase.io/team/digitaldefiance)
  - Discord: [discord.gg/8ASAAxzyyM](https://discord.gg/8ASAAxzyyM)

I'm always working on side projects and enjoy starting new things. I usually circle back to projects eventually. Currently, I'm reviving some projects and focusing on:

- TypeScript projects are in [NX](https://nx.dev/) based monorepos and typically MERN stacks
- Several secret projects currently in private repos, which will be open source upon release. Keep an eye on the [Digital Defiance](https://github.com/Digital-Defiance) organization for updates.

**Highlighted Projects:**

  - [BrightChain - MERN](https://github.com/Digital-Defiance/BrightChain)
  - [Dominion Assistant - React](https://github.com/Digital-Defiance/DominionAssistant)
  - [Star Realms Assistant - React](https://github.com/Digital-Defiance/StarRealmsAssistant)
  - [OpenBook - NodeJS](https://github.com/Digital-Defiance/OpenBook)
  - [Chili and Cilantro - MERN](https://github.com/Digital-Defiance/chili-and-cilantro)

**Older Projects::**

  - [GridIron - C++](https://github.com/Digital-Defiance/gridiron)
  - [Baileyâ€“Borweinâ€“Plouffe Pi Calculator - C#](https://github.com/JessicaMulein/BBPPiCalculator)
  - [LUHN-module-n - C#](https://github.com/JessicaMulein/LUHN-mod-n)
  - [John Walker's ENT - C# port](https://github.com/JessicaMulein/ENT)

  - [Asterisk prompts generated with Amazon Poly's Sally voice](https://github.com/JessicaMulein/asterisk-custom-poly-sounds)

My older projects aren't totally abandonedâ€”some are ideas I've thought about and may interest you. I will likely revisit them. Most are ideas in search of an audience.
